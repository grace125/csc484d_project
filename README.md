# CSC-484D Project

This repo contains a toy patching environment using the game engine [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and the audio graph [Knyst](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Getting Started

- To use, run `cargo run`.
- To create a new node press `n`. 
- To create a new edge press `e` while one node is selected, and release it over the other node you want an edge between.
  - This edge doesn't add a connection, but rather controls what connections can be created via the edit panel.
